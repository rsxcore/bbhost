# bbhost

bbhost is a translation layer that runs Bloodborne on Windows and Linux. The
game's own 1.09 executable runs unmodified on the PC's x86-64 CPU; bbhost
answers its calls into the PS4's system libraries with PC implementations, and
recompiles its GPU work, GCN shaders and the engine's draw calls, for Vulkan.
The aim is a definitive PC version of the game - the original, intact, with
what a PC release would add: any resolution and aspect ratio, 60 fps and
beyond, keyboard and mouse, proper settings, mods and online play.

bbhost contains no game code or data. You need your own copy of the game: a
dump with the 1.09 update and its decrypted executable.

## Why not emulation

The PS4 has an x86-64 CPU, so the game's code does not need to be translated
to run on a PC - it needs a place to live. bbhost provides that place:

- **The CPU side runs natively.** bbhost loads the game's ELF executable,
  relocates it, links its imports to its own implementations and starts it.
  The game's code runs at full speed on the host CPU, with no interpreter or
  recompiler involved.
- **The PS4's system libraries are reimplemented** for the PC: files and
  saves, threads and memory, input, audio, movies, networking and the
  PlayStation Network calls the online features use - every one of the 660
  named functions the game imports.
- **Graphics are being moved from emulation to native code.** The game's
  renderer was written for the PS4's GPU: it builds command buffers for an AMD
  GCN GPU and ships GCN shader programs. bbhost hooks FromSoftware's own
  graphics layer instead, so draws are built directly from the engine's objects,
  and translates (and increasingly decompiles) the shaders to SPIR-V. The
  status table below shows what is native today and what still goes through
  the emulated GPU command processor.
- **Game functions are being rewritten as source**, one at a time, each checked
  against the original, so the game can be fixed and extended where a patch
  would not reach.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| ![Yharnam in 21:9](docs/images/yharnam-ultrawide.jpg) | **Any resolution, ultrawide included.** 21:9 and 32:9 with a wider field of view and the HUD where it belongs, and the resolution can be changed while playing. FSR 1 upscaling for slower GPUs, DLSS anti-aliasing (DLAA) on RTX cards. |
| ![PC Graphics settings](docs/images/pc-graphics.jpg) | **Settings in the game's own menus.** The System menu gains PC Settings, PC Graphics, PC Effects, PC Controls, PC Camera and Key Bindings, drawn in the game's style: anti-aliasing, ambient occlusion, shadow distance, fog, motion blur, field of view, frame cap and more. |

- **60 fps**, with the game's timing corrected so physics, animation and
  cutscenes run at the right speed. Higher frame caps keep the game's logic at
  60.
- **Keyboard and mouse**: mouse camera, a pointer in every menu, rebindable
  keys, and button prompts that show the keys.
- **PC enhancements** that can be switched off for the game as it shipped: the
  Hunter's Dream mirror opens the character appearance editor (a feature cut
  from the release), "Rebirth in the Nightmare" at the Altar of
  Despair lets you redistribute your levels, and the late areas allow two
  invaders, as the chalice dungeons do.
- **Online play** through a private server: co-op, invasions, messages,
  bloodstains and summon signs between bbhost players.
- **Mods** without touching the game files: replacement files, param tables
  edited by field name, byte patches as data, and native plugins - a
  randomizer (items, shops and enemies), a boss rush, gameplay mutators and
  the developers' own debug menu ship with it.
- **A setup window** that finds and checks your game files, and the Steam Deck
  as a supported device.

## Status

The game is playable on Windows and Linux: the world, its bosses and online
sessions. What runs on native code and what is still emulated:

| Part | State |
|---|---|
| Game logic (CPU) | the game's own code, running natively |
| System libraries | reimplemented by bbhost: all 660 named imports the game binds |
| Window, input, audio, movies, saves | native (SDL3, Vulkan, FFmpeg, LibAtrac9) |
| Online | native sockets and HTTP against a private server; peer-to-peer UDP with NAT traversal |
| Draws | native: each draw is built from the engine's graphics objects; the command buffer only marks its place in the stream |
| Post-processing (YEBIS) | native: every stage's resources built by bbhost |
| Tessellation | native: the host GPU's own tessellation stages |
| Shaders | translated from GCN to SPIR-V by bbhost's own compiler when the game creates them; pixel shaders the lifter accepts are decompiled to typed, structured SPIR-V instead |
| Frame pacing | native: the game's frame-time manager runs as bbhost source; 30 fps by default, 60 by option |
| Compute dispatches, labels, fences | still emulated: run through bbhost's command processor, which walks the game's PM4 command buffers |
| Texture memory | the game's tiled textures are detiled on the GPU; changes are tracked by watching the game's writes |

Known issues:

- Compute work still goes through the emulated command processor, and the
  game's GPU-visible memory (about 5 GB) stays imported into Vulkan, because
  some shaders still read it through page-table walks.
- A new area compiles its pipelines on first sight, which can cause short
  hitches the first time it is visited.
- About one in four first summons fail and have to be repeated.
- The cause of a GPU hang reported on an AMD RX 580 (Polaris) under Windows is
  not yet known.

See [docs/rendering.md](docs/rendering.md) for the graphics in detail and
[docs/decomp.md](docs/decomp.md) for which game functions have been rewritten.

## Getting started

1. Get the game files: a dump of Bloodborne with the 1.09 update copied over
   it (or kept beside it as `CUSA00900-UPDATE`, the way shadPS4 keeps it), and
   the 1.09 `eboot.bin` decrypted to an ELF (SHA-256
   `941f887a562aae054fac35af8cc8f27cf075f3d4cc2e029fb5ae2a663aaa5ae7`).
2. Download a release for Windows or Linux, or build bbhost yourself.
3. Start `bbhost`. The setup window asks for the two paths, checks them and
   saves them; press Play.

[docs/running.md](docs/running.md) covers the configuration, the controls,
saves, logs and troubleshooting.

## Building

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build -j
./build/bbhost
```

Linux builds natively with GCC or Clang; the Windows executable is
cross-compiled from Linux with Clang and mingw-w64 (MSVC cannot express the
calling conventions involved). Dependencies, the Windows build, tests and
packaging are in [docs/building.md](docs/building.md).

## Roadmap

- **Graphics, native throughout**: compute dispatches, clears and copies built
  from the engine's objects like the draws, so the PM4 command processor can be
  retired; resources identified by the engine's own objects rather than guest
  addresses; every shader decompiled rather than translated.
- **Decompilation**: more of the engine rewritten as source, starting with the
  systems mods and fixes need most.
- **Performance**: a steady 60 fps everywhere on mid-range hardware, and
  headroom above it.
- **PC features**: more settings, better keyboard and mouse handling in every
  screen, and more restored content.
