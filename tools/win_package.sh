bbhost for Windows, build $name
================================

bbhost runs Bloodborne on PC: the game's own 1.09 executable, its calls into
the PS4's system libraries answered by bbhost and its graphics recompiled for
Vulkan. Free software under the GNU GPL, version 3 or later (LICENSE.txt); the
source is at https://github.com/droogie/bbhost.

You need
  - Your own copy of Bloodborne, dumped from your own PS4 - nothing from the
    game is in this package:
      - the game folder (CUSA00900) with the 1.09 update's files copied over
        it: the folder that contains dvdroot_ps4, whose sce_sys/param.sfo
        says APP_VER 01.09. Or the update kept beside it in a folder named
        after it with -UPDATE appended (CUSA00900-UPDATE), the way shadPS4
        keeps a game library: bbhost reads the update's files from there;
      - the 1.09 update's eboot.bin, decrypted to an ELF. Its SHA-256 must be
        941f887a562aae054fac35af8cc8f27cf075f3d4cc2e029fb5ae2a663aaa5ae7;
        bbhost stops at start and says why when it is another version (a
        dump without the update has the 1.00 eboot, which will not do).
  - Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit, and a graphics card with a Vulkan 1.3 driver
    (update the driver first).
  - A controller, or keyboard and mouse.

Install
  Unzip this folder somewhere of its own, for example C:\\Games\\bbhost, and
  double-click run-bbhost.bat. The first time, the setup window opens: pick
  the game folder and the decrypted eboot with the Browse buttons (each turns
  green when it is right), then Play. run-bbhost.bat --setup opens it again.

  The settings are kept in %APPDATA%\\bbhost\\bbhost.toml, which every copy of
  bbhost reads, so a new download or an update needs nothing set again. The
  F10 settings and your account sign-in are kept beside it, saves and caches
  in %LOCALAPPDATA%\\bbhost\\data. bbhost.example.toml lists every setting.

Start the game
  Double-click run-bbhost.bat. A console window stays open while you play and
  says where the log goes (logs\\bbhost-<date>-<time>.log); the game window
  appears. The first time, Windows may say "Windows protected your PC": click
  More info, then Run anyway.

DLSS (NVIDIA RTX cards)
  F10 > Graphics > DLSS swaps the game's anti-aliasing for NVIDIA's DLAA. It
  needs nvngx_dlss.dll beside bbhost.exe, which NVIDIA's license does not let
  bbhost ship: double-click get-dlss.bat once and it downloads it from
  NVIDIA's own DLSS repository (github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS), checks its SHA-256
  and puts it here.

  When Windows Defender Firewall asks whether bbhost may communicate on
  networks, tick Private and Public and click Allow access: other players
  reach you on UDP port 9307, and a blocked port is the most common reason
  summons fail. (If you clicked Cancel: Windows Security > Firewall & network
  protection > Allow an app through firewall, and allow bbhost.exe.)

  The first visit to an area stutters for a moment while its graphics are
  prepared for your card; later visits do not.

  F10 opens the PC settings at any time: resolution, window mode, V-Sync,
  frame cap, mouse, key bindings and your account.

Online
  bbhost plays online on the community server, https://thehuntersdream.com,
  with other bbhost players (not with PS4s). The game stays offline until this
  PC is linked to an account, and the account's name is your name online.
  Link it once, in the setup window's Account section or with F10 > ACCOUNT
  at the title screen:
    - Log in with Discord (Link with Discord in F10): a code appears and your
      browser opens https://thehuntersdream.com/link. Sign in there with
      Discord, check that the page names this PC, and approve.
    - Create account on this PC: type a name (3 to 16 letters, digits, _ or
      -). A recovery code appears once. Write it down: it is the only way to
      get the account back on another PC or after reinstalling (Recover
      account takes the name and that code).
  Then choose Play Online at the title.

  Co-op: the host rings the Beckoning Bell and the helper the Small Resonant
  Bell, in the same area. Invasions: the Sinister Resonant Bell. Messages,
  bloodstains and phantoms work as on the console. The website has the live
  map of deaths and messages, the leaderboards and your account page (Public
  profile puts your name on them).

  If summons keep failing with one person, forwarding UDP port 9307 to this
  PC on your router often fixes it. Two PCs in one house: set p2p_addr under
  [online] in the per-user bbhost.toml to each PC's local address.

Plugins
  plugins/ holds the official ones, signed by the bbhost release key
  (the .sig beside each). Turn them on and set them up in the setup
  window's Plugins tab (run-bbhost.bat --setup), which can also fetch the
  latest official plugins; in the game, F9 opens the plugin menu (start the
  boss rush there). Or in the per-user bbhost.toml:
      [plugins]
      randomizer = true    # every pickup and shop shuffled from a seed
      boss_rush = true     # the game's bosses back to back, timed
      mutators = true      # speed, bullet time, one-hit, chaos and more
      debug_menu = true    # the developers' debug menu: \` opens it
  Each one's settings go in a section of its own name ([randomizer],
  [boss_rush], [mutators]); docs/plugins.md in the repository lists them.
  Use the boss rush on a save of its own. Cheating against other players
  with the debug menu gets an account banned; trying it out online with
  friends is fine.

Reporting a problem
  Send the log of that session from the logs folder (privately: it contains
  your internet address), with what happened, when, your account name and
  your graphics card. If the game crashed, the log ends with a block starting
  "SIGSEGV pc=" with the registers, the guest address and the host
  module+offset; the release's $name.debug.exe symbolizes the host addresses:
      addr2line -f -C -e $name.debug.exe 0x<link address>
  If the log stops without that block, the process was ended from outside
  bbhost (inside the GPU driver, or by Windows): Event Viewer, Windows Logs >
  Application, has an "Application Error" entry with the faulting module and
  exception code - send that with the log.

  A wrong picture (wrong colours, a green or black screen, missing parts):
  press F12 in the game while it shows. bbhost writes that frame, the images
  the game drew it from and its list of draws into a folder of its own in
  logs (logs\\f12-<date>-<time>; the log names it). Zip that folder
  (right-click, Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder) and send it with the
  log.

Switches (environment variables)
  Set one in a Command Prompt opened in this folder, then start from there:
      set BBHOST_F12_PNG=1
      run-bbhost.bat
  BBHOST_GPU_DEVICE=N      the GPU to use, by the log's "gpu: device N"
                           index or part of its name; the default is a
                           discrete GPU over an on-board one
  BBHOST_SKIP_INTRO=1      skip the company logos (bbhost.toml has it)
  BBHOST_DUMP_FRAME=N      write the displayed frame N as build/frame-N.ppm
  BBHOST_F12_PNG=1         F12 writes PNG files (any image viewer opens
                           them, a fifth of the size) instead of PPM
  BBHOST_F12_TEXTURES=1    F12 also writes every texture the frame used
                           (the game pauses while it writes them)
  BBHOST_EXIT_FLIP=N       end the run at flip N with the exit reports
  BBHOST_SAMPLE=main       the sampler: build/samples.txt + .maps
  BBHOST_HEADLESS=1        no window
