// release build looks for a newer release at start; the F10 screen's UPDATES
// rows and the setup window say what it found, and a newer release's page
// opens in the browser, where the player downloads it. bbhost never downloads
// or replaces its own executable.
//
// update.source is the "releases/latest" API URL; a private repository's
// needs update.token_file. Nothing is sent but that token and a user agent:
// never the account's.
//
// Each release carries the bare executables under the same names every time
// (bbhost.exe, bbhost), SHA256SUMS and SHA256SUMS.sig, besides the packages.
// Older builds' updater looked for bbhost-<tag>-windows.exe; finding none, it
// says to get the release from its page. The release key below signs
// SHA256SUMS and the official plugins.
