// screen (F10), the port's rows in the game's System menu and
// bbhost-options.toml edit by name (host/options.h), read back by every
// consumer as typed, already-scaled fields. The table in options.cpp is the
// single source; it rebuilds this snapshot on every change, and a reader
// takes a copy (host_settings()) whenever host_opt_serial() has moved, or
// on the frame it needs it - the copy is small and the lock is short.
//
// The graphics half is shaped after what DS3 keeps in its CSGraphicsConfig
// (the released PC binary's RTTI names the class): per-effect switches and
// strengths the renderer applies each frame, held in one place instead of
// a copy in each consumer.
