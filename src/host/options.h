//
// These settings configure *bbhost*, not the game: resolution, pacing, what
// the pointer does. The PS4 build has nowhere to put them and the dump is
// never written, so the host draws the screen and owns the file it saves to.
// Coordinates are display-buffer pixels, the space
// host_mouse_state() and the overlay already share.
//
// The screen is modal: while it is open the game sees no pad and no pointer.
