// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The System menu, as the engine actually builds it
//
// `sub_1faf8c0` is the menu-path dispatcher: it takes a wide string and opens
// the screen it names. `u"System"` runs `sub_1fb3ad0`; `u"System/Language"`,
// `u"System/Network"` and the rest run `sub_1fb4c70` with the matching opener.
//
// `sub_1fb3ad0` is a **command list**, built one row at a time into a local
// builder and finalised by `sub_1fea630`. A row is
//
//     sub_1f4e2a0(builder, captions, std::function<Dlg*(Dlg*, Ctx)>, &flag)
//
// and it is removed again by popping 0x180 bytes off the vector at
// builder+0x60. The six rows and what each one opens:
//
//     msg 0x1adb0  Controls     sub_1fb4e00 -> sub_1fdb960
//     msg 0x1adb1  Environment  sub_1fb4e90 -> sub_1fdb980
//     msg 0x1adb2  Brightness   sub_1fb4f20 -> sub_1fdb9a0
//     msg 0x1adb3  Network      sub_1fb4fb0 -> sub_1fdb9c0
//     msg 0x1adb4  Exit Game    sub_200c9f0            (added by sub_1f4c9a0)
//     msg 0x1adb5  Language     sub_1fb4be0 -> sub_1fdb940
//
// `sub_1fb3ad0`'s third argument decides which of the last two survives: with
// it set Language is popped, with it clear Exit Game is. Both callers the
// title flow uses pass 1.
//
// An **opener** is five instructions and nothing else:
//
//     sub_1fdb9x0(root, params) -> sub_1f20900(root, params, "<Name>Setting",
//                                              handler, 0, 0)
//
// and `sub_1f20900` does the rest: it walks the six-name table at 0x57398b0,
// binds the sprite whose name matches, allocates a 0xf20 dialog, and calls
// `handler(dialog, dialog + 0xeb0)`. The handler builds the rows; the engine
// owns the cursor, the widgets, the key guide and the fade.
//
// So the port does not need any of the game's five. It writes its **own**
// opener - a host function that calls `sub_1f20900` with its own sprite name
// and its own handler - and adds a **seventh row** to the command list that
// runs it. Language keeps `sub_1fdb940`, Environment keeps `sub_1fdb980`, and
// every section but the port's is untouched code.
//
// That leaves two guest patches, both small and both name-checked:
//
//   1. the section-name table gets a seventh slot, so `sub_1f20900` will bind
//      the port's sprites (the overlay movie adds them). The slot holds a
//      pointer to a name the port writes before each open, so one slot serves
//      every section the port has;
//   2. the one `call sub_1fea630` that finalises the System builder is
//      redirected, so the port can append its row before the dialog is made.
//
// Everything else - the movie section, the rows, the values - is the port's
// own.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The Key Bindings screen
//
// DS3 PC's key configuration is a scrolling table, a tab per group of actions,
// and "press the key" to change one. Bloodborne's sections do not scroll and
// their rows only ever write a value - but every list these rows use draws its
// items from raw UTF-16 pointers, through a provider that runs again whenever
// the list is redrawn (sub_1ed06e0; sub_1f263b0 for a choice row's value). So
// the port points a row's caption, line help and value at buffers of its own,
// and changing what the screen says is writing those buffers and redrawing.
// That gives DS3's shape in the game's own widgets:
//
//   - row 0 names the page - DS3's tabs. It is a text row like the others,
//     and Left / Right (or Circle, or a click) step it: the game's pick list
//     would have opened translucent over the seven rows below it;
//   - rows 1-7 are the page's actions, each a one-entry choice row showing its
//     binding ("X  /  Right Button"). Choosing another page rewrites all seven
//     in place;
//   - Circle on an action (Enter, or a click) starts a capture
//     (host/bindings.h): the row reads "Press a key", the game sees an idle
//     pad, and the next key or mouse button becomes the binding. Escape
//     cancels, Delete unbinds, and a key another action had is taken from it.
//   - Delete on a selected action clears it, key and mouse button both, so an
//     action a capture gave a second binding can be brought back to one.
//
// All of it runs in the menu's own list update (option_menu_list_update), on
// the thread that owns these objects, and only while the objects are provably
// this screen's: each action row's value pointer is one of the port's.
